# Art-Gallery-Visitor-System
🎨 Art Gallery Visitor Management System: <br>
A Java OOP & Swing–based Visitor Management Application <br>
This project is a fully functional Art Gallery Visitor Management System built using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Abstraction, <br> Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, along with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing. <br>
The system allows an art gallery to register visitors, manage ticket types, track visits, handle purchases and cancellations, assign personal art advisors, calculate discounts and rewards, and store visitor activity through file handling.

Features:
The system supports two levels of visitors:
1. Standard Visitor
-Visit limits
-Discount upgrade eligibility
-Basic reward system

2. Elite Visitor
-Access to Personal Art Advisor
-Exclusive event access
-Enhanced discount/reward mechanisms

### Parent class that is shared across all visitors
*ArtGalleryVisitor (Abstract Parent Class)
-Attributes & behaviors shared across all visitors
-Acts as the base for inheritance
