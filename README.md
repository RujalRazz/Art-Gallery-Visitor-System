🎨 Art Gallery Visitor Management System
A Java OOP & Swing–based Visitor Management Application
This project is a fully functional Art Gallery Visitor Management System built using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, along with a graphical user interface built using Java Swing.
The system allows an art gallery to register visitors, manage ticket types, track visits, handle purchases and cancellations, assign personal art advisors, calculate discounts and rewards, and store visitor activity through file handling.
